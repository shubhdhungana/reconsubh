See reconsubhTest which is being updated frequently with more tools being added.

Keep in mind, it just doesn't work like magic out of thin air. First of all need to dowload the below listed tool properly in your unix kernel.

Download these tools properly in your unix kernel via google/youtube tutorials. It's easy:
i) Assetfinder
ii) Subfinder
iii) Sublist3r
iv) nmap
v) Aquatone
vi) Waybackurls
vii) ffuf

Download these above tools in your very unix kernel. Make sure it works fine. You can watch youtube tutorials. It's easy. Then run my script.

Follow the steps as shown in the example.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Example:
[ Suppose you downloaded reconsubhTest Script in your desktop folder ]
Then,
In cmd,
i) chmod u+x reconsubhTest [ This cmd will give executable permission to the script ] 
ii) reconsubhTest facebook.com [ This will start hacking facebook.com ]

Bonus Section:
--------------
I recommend not to use this tool just to find bugs incase if you're just starting to do Web Application Testing, Pentesting, Bug Bounty Hunting, etc.
Even if you use that tool and you get the fascinating result, it doesn't impact much. If you don't know the basic of networking, programming and web
app workflow mechanism, it'd be completely waste.

So, my suggestion is first we need to have a deeper understanding of web application workflow, networking, client-server concept before starting out.
Read books like "Bug Bounty Bootcamp by Vickie li", "Web Application Hackers Handbook", "Real-World Bug Hunting: A Field Guide to Web Hacking". These 
books will give you the deeper concept of web application workflow, its mechanisms. You'd figure it out yourself how to exploit it.
